je_korean_writing_system: "The Issue of Hanja"
je_korean_writing_system_reason: "As a result of our prolonged contact with the Chinese cultural sphere, Chinese customs and creations have been prevalent in the Korean Peninsula for over 1300 years.

However, tensions with the local Uighur Turks have risen as a result, and if Chinese authority in the region were to suddenly collapse, the fate of Xinjiang, and that of its Han settlers will be left up in the air"
